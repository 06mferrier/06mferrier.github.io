# My PhD Project: Lay Summary

Research mathematics is a peculiar world, where academics sit down in quiet rooms and think about very abstract things. If you were to find your nearest pure mathematician and ask them what they are interested in, their answer will most likely follow the pattern “I am interested in _insert very abstract sounding thing here_ satisfying certain properties”. One problem with trying to study abstract things is that we can’t use any of our usual tools to study them; we can’t pick them up and look at them with our eyes, we can’t measure them with rulers, or weigh them with scales, we can’t even take a sample from them and look at it under a microscope. We need special tools to study them with!

My project was to develop one such tool, called Morita equivalence, for a type of abstract thing called C\*-categories. A C\*-category consists of two collections of data; a collection of objects, and a collection of arrows. Sounds simple right? The arrows describe the ways in which we can move between different objects. In the picture to the right, A,B,C,D & E are all objects in a C\*-category. The arrows tell us things like we can move freely between A,B & C and move freely between  D & E, but we can’t go from A to E. I have swept a certain amount of details under the carpet here, but we don't need to worry about them for this summary

There could be any number of objects in a C\*-category, and there could be any number of arrows between each pair of objects, so it should be clear that these things can very easily become pretty complex. Therefore we need some special tools so that we can study them. Morita equivalence is a type of representation theory. The idea behind representation theory is that we don’t try to directly examine the thing we are interested in, but rather we look at how it acts on other, simpler things. 

A good analogy to think of would be the following; imagine that you encounter a stranger in the street and want to find out more about them. Of course you could interrogate the person directly, but perhaps they aren’t particularly honest about themselves, or maybe they don’t speak the same language as you, or maybe they ran away as soon as you stopped them and started questioning them. It could be very difficult to get the information you want directly. Another way you could approach the task would be to ask their friends, or colleagues, or employer what they are like. That way you would find out information about the person in question, by learning about how they act on other people in their life. 

So this is what my PhD project involved; developing tools to indirectly study C\*-categories. Simple!
