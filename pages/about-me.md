# About Me

My name is Matthew, I live in Sheffield and was awarded my PhD in Mathematics in 2023. Since graduating, I found myself in the same position as many others; I had no idea what career path I wanted to take. In my current role, I am responsible for the service, calibration and repair of portable medical devices for one of the country's largest distributors. I have always enjoyed learning about new things, which is something that drew me to working with electronics. After all, I'm certainly not an electrical engineer. However, there is limited scope for creative work as a service technician, and spending time away from academia has shown me that I actually miss writing. This leads me the the present day, where I am looking for roles involving technical writing.
