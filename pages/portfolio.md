# Portfolio
This page contains links to written works I have produced. Some content is mathematical, some content is not. This is intended to showcase a range of works that have been produced using different tools, and written with different audiences in mind. Each heading is a link to the relevant piece of writing, which will open in a new tab.

## User Guides and Tech Tips
In my current role at Numed Healthcare, I write company specific guides for how to use Sage 200 software and Eureka Addons and tech tips that are sent to customers to explain common faults caused by user error.  Due to the nature of these documents, I will not share them freely over the internet, but would be happy to discuss and share these over private email. 

## [Getting Started With Git](/pages/git-basics){:target=_blank"}
A brief intordution to using Git. Includes the basic workflow of cloning, branching and pull requesting a repository. Written with Markdown, this started life as part of a Technical Author take home assignment I completed, but now serves as a future reference for myself. This page is still a minor work in progress and there are some changes and additions still to be made.

## [My Notes From Google's Technical Writing One Course](https://06mferrier.github.io/tech-writing-notes.github.io/build/site/tech-writing-one/index.html){:target="_blank"}
This link takes you to a static site, written using Asciidoc and generated using Antora. It contains my notes and exercise solutions from Google's technical writing one course. It is heavily based on the structure of [Google's original pages](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one){:target="_blank"} but I have produced it as an exercise for me in working with new tools.

## [PhD Thesis: Morita Equivalence for C*-Categories](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/32345/){:target="_blank"}
The link above opens the White Rose repository containing my thesis. There is a link on the right hand side of that page to view the PDF file. 

My project was in the  area of non-commutative geometry and combined functional analysis and category theory to develop tools to study Hilbert modules over C\*-categories, and explain in more detail existing constructions used in present literature. The audience for this work is very niche, however it is the longest example of written work I have produced. This file was typeset with LaTeX.

## [PhD Thesis: Lay Summary](/pages/phd-layman){:target="_blank"}
This is a lay summary of my PhD project. It should be understandable for people without a background in university maths. 

## [MSc Thesis: Banach and C* Algebras](/files/ferrier-msc-final.pdf){:target="_blank"}
This thesis was produced during my studies at the University of Leeds. The thesis covers the basic theory of Banach and C\*-algebras, up to the Gelfand-Neumark theorem for C\*-algebras. The final chapter looks at C\*-algebras of canonical commutation relations. The material should be accessible to those with a decent working knowledge of functional analysis. This file was typeset with LaTeX.

## [MATH5015m Linear Analysis, Chapter 1](/files/math5015m-chapter-1.pdf){:target="_blank"}
The first chapter of the notes I made during the course MATH5015m at the University of Leeds. This course was an introduction to functional analysis, measure theory, spaces of Lp integrable functions and Fourier theory on groups. This chapter should be accessible to those familiar with real analysis and theory of vector spaces. This file was typeset with LaTeX. I have more notes from this module, but adding them to this document remains a work in progress.
