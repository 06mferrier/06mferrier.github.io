# Portfolio
This page contains links to written works I have produced. Some content is mathematical, some content is not. This is intended to be a range of works, produced using different tools, and written with different audiences in mind. I have arranged the links below so that the most accessible writing examples appear before any intense maths.

## PhD Thesis
[Morita Equivalence for C*-Categories](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/32345/){:target="_blank"}

The link above opens the White Rose repository containing my thesis. There is a link on the right hand side of that page to view the PDF file. 

My project was in the  area of non-commutative geometry and combined functional analysis and category theory to develop tools to study Hilbert modules over C\*-categories, and explain in more detail existing constructions used in present literature. The audience for this work is very niche, however it is the longest example of written work I have produced. This file was typeset with LaTeX.

## MSc Thesis
Link: [Banach and C* Algebras](/files/ferrier-msc-final.pdf){:target="_blank"}

This thesis was produced during my studies at the University of Leeds. The thesis covers the basic theory of Banach and C\*-algebras, up to the Gelfand-Neumark theorem for C\*-algebras. The final chapter looks at so called CCR C\*-algebras. The material should be accessible to those with a decent working knowledge of functional analysis. This file was typeset with LaTeX.

## MATH5015m Linear Analysis, Chapter 1
Once I have uploaded it, the link to this PDF will go here.

The link above opens the first chapter of the notes I made during the course MATH5015m at the University of Leeds. This course was an introduction to functional analysis, measure theory, spaces of Lp integrable functions and Fourier theory on groups. This chapter should be accessible to those familiar with real analysis and theory of vector spaces. This file was typeset with LaTeX.
