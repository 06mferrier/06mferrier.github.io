# Portfolio
This page contains links to written works I have produced. Some content is mathematical, some content is not. This is intended to showcase a range of works that have been produced using different tools, and written with different audiences in mind. I have arranged the links below so that the most accessible writing examples appear before any intense maths. Each heading serves as the link to the relevant piece of writing.

## My Notes From Google's Technical Writing Course
This link takes you to a static site, written using Asciidoc and generated using Antora. It contains my notes and exercise solutions from Google's technical writing one course. It is heavily based on the structure of [Google's original pages](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one){:target="_blank"} but was produced as an exercise for me in working with new tools.

_I still need to turn the relevant repository into a github pages site, and link to it_


## How to Write Mathematics Help Pages
This link takes you to a static site, (most likley) written using Asciidoc and generated using Antora. It contains my efforts at providing clear documentation for undergraduate students on how to write and proofread mathematics at university level.

_I have a plan for the content of this site, but I still need to create it_

## [PhD Thesis: Morita Equivalence for C*-Categories](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/32345/){:target="_blank"}
The link above opens the White Rose repository containing my thesis. There is a link on the right hand side of that page to view the PDF file. 

My project was in the  area of non-commutative geometry and combined functional analysis and category theory to develop tools to study Hilbert modules over C\*-categories, and explain in more detail existing constructions used in present literature. The audience for this work is very niche, however it is the longest example of written work I have produced. This file was typeset with LaTeX.

## [MSc Thesis: Banach and C* Algebras](/files/ferrier-msc-final.pdf){:target="_blank"}
This thesis was produced during my studies at the University of Leeds. The thesis covers the basic theory of Banach and C\*-algebras, up to the Gelfand-Neumark theorem for C\*-algebras. The final chapter looks at C\*-algebras of canonical commutation relations. The material should be accessible to those with a decent working knowledge of functional analysis. This file was typeset with LaTeX.

## [MATH5015m Linear Analysis, Chapter 1](/files/math5015m-chapter-1.pdf){:target="_blank"}
The first chapter of the notes I made during the course MATH5015m at the University of Leeds. This course was an introduction to functional analysis, measure theory, spaces of Lp integrable functions and Fourier theory on groups. This chapter should be accessible to those familiar with real analysis and theory of vector spaces. This file was typeset with LaTeX. I have more notes from this module, but adding them to this document remains a work in progress.
