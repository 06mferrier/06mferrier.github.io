# Portfolio
This page contains links to written works I have produced. Some content is mathematical, some content is not. My intention is for this to be a range of works, produced using different tools, and written with different audiences in mind.

## PhD Thesis
[Morita Equivalence for C*-Categories](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/32345/){:target="_blank"}

The link above opens the White Rose repository containing my thesis. There is a link on the right hand side of that page to view the PDF file. 

My project was in the  area of non-commutative geometry and combined functional analysis and category theory to develop tools to study Hilbert modules over C*-categories, and explain in more detail existing constructions used in present literature. The audience for this work is very niche, however it is the longest example of written work I have produced. It was typeset with LaTeX.
